Process simulation and optimization models for chemical reactors and separation systems
# Chemical Process Modeling

This repository demonstrates **process simulation and optimization** workflows
for chemical reactors, separation systems, and multiphase processes.

The focus is on integrating computational chemistry outputs (DFT, ML predictions)
with process-level modeling to design efficient, scalable, and sustainable chemical processes.
